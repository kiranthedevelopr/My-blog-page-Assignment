    <h3>Second Inspiration</h3>
    <h4><strong> Zukerberg</strong></h4>
    <p>
        Mark Zuckerberg, in full Mark Elliot Zuckerberg, (born May 14, 1984, White Plains, New York, U.S.), American
        computer programmer who was cofounder and CEO (2004– ) of Facebook, a social networking Web site.After attending
        Phillips Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University in 2002. On February 4, 2004, he launched
        thefacebook.com (renamed Facebook in 2005), a directory in which fellow Harvard students entered their own
        information and photos into a template that he had devised. Within two weeks half of the student body had signed
        up. Zuckerberg’s roommates, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, helped him add features and make the site
        available to other campuses across the country. Facebook quickly became popular as registered users could create
        profiles, upload photos and other media, and keep in touch with friends.<dfn> It differed from other social
            networking sites, however, in its emphasis on real names (and e-mail addresses), or“trusted connections.” It
            also laid particular emphasis on networking, with information disseminated not only to each individual’s
            network of friends but also to friends of friends—what Zuckerberg called the “social graph.”</dfn>

    </p>
    <p>In October 2021 Facebook announced that it was changing the name of its parent company to Meta Platforms.The name
        change reflected an emphasis on the “metaverse”, in which users would interact in virtual reality environments.
